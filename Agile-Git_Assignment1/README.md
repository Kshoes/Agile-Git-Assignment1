# Git Assignment 1

The article I chose was [Can Blockchain Solve Dataâ€™s Privacy Problem?](https://sdtimes.com/data/can-blockchain-solve-datas-privacy-problem/)

I found this article interesting because it discusses the potential for blockchain technology use in the field of data, which has risen to the forefront because of recent concerns in privacy, mainly due to the Cambridge Analytica incident and also a general increase of awareness in personal data usage by corporations.

>By decentralizing data using a blockchain solution, the consumers know who can have access to their private information through the ledger, which increases the sense of ownership and trust from the consumer. Corporations can also benefit from a blockchain solution by reducing the amount of time spent tracking down and sharing data, improving agility and performance through using distributed systems.

Overall, this article sheds a light on the potential for blockchain to solve a growing problem in today's corporate society, which I find pretty cool.
